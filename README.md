# Christmas 3D Game Demo (Defold)

A small Christmas-themed 3D demo in Defold. The main goal is to share my 3D experience and tool for Defold

## Highlights
- Character animation pipeline: defmesh fork + Blender Python exporter, GPU skinning with tracks baked into a texture, and a custom fp16 binary mesh format to reduce asset size.
- 3D character controller: movement, jump, and extra step-up force for small obstacles (stairs, stones).
- In-game 3D editor using ImGui: create objects, edit properties, move/rotate/scale.
- ECS for 3D world setup.
- Forward+ lighting with shadows and fog.

## Assets
