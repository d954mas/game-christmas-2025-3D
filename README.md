# Demo: 2D Game with Box2D and Tiled Levels

A small Defold example project. The goal is to showcase a basic 2D game with Box2D physics and loading a level exported from Tiled.

## What's inside
- 2D scene with Box2D physics
- level export from Tiled


## Windows note
I work on Windows. The Tiled export uses `.bat`/`.sh` scripts. It should work, but it is untested and paths might need adjustments.
